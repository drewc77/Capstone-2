# Predicting Student Performance
For this project, I have loaded in data from a Kaggle dataset on American high school students, which contains specific variables about each student, as well as their test scores on 3 standardized tests.  The goal of this project was to identify correlations between specific variables about each student and their test scores, and to see which  of these variables are the strongest and most important indicators of a studentâ€™s overall test scores.  This includes building various models to see how well I can predict a student's score based on these variables, and determining which type of model works best for this application.
